<h1>Phonebook Project</h1>
<p>The graphical interface can be executed via the "Phonebook.jar" file, however the file must be placed in the same folder where the "informations" and "icons" folders are contained.


<ul>
<li>informations -> contains information about your phone book contacts;</li>
<li>icons -> contains all the icon used for the buttons in the interface</li>
</ul>

All the code used to create this project is placed in the "src" folder.

</p>
